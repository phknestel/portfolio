The same applies to the 5/3/1 plan.</p>\n<p>So if you decided to try the 5/3/1 plan you have to do two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the gym and test your 1 rep maxes for given major lifts (squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press) - unfortunately, there is no other way ;)</li>\n<li>Calculate weight progression for each lift by calculating 90% of 1 rep max and then in turn calculating progression for each lift in the following weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second point is the hard part. People either give up at that point or if they are determined get a calculator from the deepest drawer in their house (or basement) and do the math. OR they calculate this stuff in an Excel spreadsheet - that was my case. But someday I decided that it would be easier for others if my excel spreadsheet looked better and was publicly available. Therefore I decided to create a strength-hub - a web app - where you can log in, input your one-rep maxes which are then safely stored in a database and which you can access anywhere on any device.</p>"}
