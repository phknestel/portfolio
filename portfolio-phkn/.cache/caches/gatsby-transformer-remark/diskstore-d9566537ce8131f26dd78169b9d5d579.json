As with all hand calculations they were prone to errors. What's more - I had no way to check, whether my calculations were correct. I searched for similar program on the web with no results. Therefore, I decided to create one for myself. Probably I could have found a library for this task, but I thought that it will be a good learning project nevertheless. You may find this notebook useful if you are tasked with similar problem.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":3,"column":601,"offset":602}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":2},"end":{"line":3,"column":601,"offset":602}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This notebook solves the problem of presenting the user with results and visualisation of all the steps that perceptron algorithm took while calculating the decision boundary for 2 input points.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":604},"end":{"line":5,"column":195,"offset":798}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":604},"end":{"line":5,"column":195,"offset":798}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It is a simple example, and I do not guarantee its correctness. It works but further testing is required. I am by no mean an expert in the field of machine learning, deep learning or artificial intelligence. I created this notebook as a way to reinforce my learning and provide myself with visual representation and steps that perceptron took to get to the solution.
