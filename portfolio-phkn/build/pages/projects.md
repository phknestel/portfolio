# üß™ Projects
## [Roboy](https://roboy.github.io/rollbody/) üîó

- Rollbody allows a remote operator wearing a VR headset to have an immersive telepresence experience. This **robot** was built as a university project in the summer semester of 2022.
- Challange:
  - Our robot's big brother Roboy does not walk on his two legs yet. Therefore, as our main challenge we wanted to build a mobile telepresence robot that is operated through remote control in a virtual reality environment.
  - In order to develop an intuitive and immersive telepresence experience, we also researched relative topics on computer vision, control, etc.
- Target: 
  - Height Control
  - Power
  - Locomotion
  - Head Animation
  - VR Unity App
  - 180¬∞ Stereo Vision

- _**Technologies used:**_ java, Unity, Python, ROS2, C#

## [cvat-PDMS](https://github.com/phknestel/cvat-PDMS) üîó

- CVAT is free, online, interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision.
- Within a practical semester course at TUM in conjunction with [HERA-MI](https://www.hera-mi.com), I worked on an application of CVAT in medical image annotation.
- Target: 
  - Increase usability
  - 3D image review
  - Imaging layout

- _**Technologies used:**_ JS, CSS, HTML, Python

## [GlobalLocalNews](https://github.com/phknestel/GlobalLocalNews) üîó

- Interactive world map to show the local news of the country/region/city you click at.
- _**Technologies used:**_ JS, CSS, HTML

## [Katla-Technologies](https://github.com/phknestel/Katla-Technologies) üîó

The goal of the project is to build an underwater robot (about 50cm long) that recognizes the environment (for now a bathtub). 
Therefore we will make the mobile platform waterproof as soon as the 3D navigation works well over water.

**Summary:**
The vision here is a robotic whale which filters microplastics and small plastics from the water instead of krill.
Unlike conventional nets with the same goals, our method would not kill other life forms.
Instinctively, all sea creatures capable of doing so seem to counteract the suction of a blue whale. Similarly, nets drag on the ocean floor and therefore destroy habitats. On this page you can see our advances in robotics. 

&nbsp;

Difficulties here:
- Autonomous safe behavior under water 
- reliable filtering system.

- _**Technologies used:**_ JS, CSS, HTML

## [Stock Website](https://github.com/phknestel/StockWebsite) üîó

- Different categories of companies and their shares
- Dropdown menu and other navigation in JS
- Live tracking of stock prices via a Tradingview interface
- _**Technologies used:**_ JS, CSS, HTML, php
