**Summary:**
Does a visualization of robot states by means of augmented reality improve the communication between man and machine? For the discussion of the most important functions of such an augmented reality application, a survey has been conducted among the employees of Franka Emika. Subsequently, an augmented reality application for iOS was developed in Unity. Based on the survey, a demo of the Franka Emika prototype 'Garmi' and a demo of the 'Panda' arm, also from Franka Emika, were implemented. For this, the application on the smartphone recognizes the surfaces in the environment. As a mixed reality approach, the third function, 'Panda Inside', was developed. Here, the application is supplied with live data from the 'Panda' arm and maps this data onto the real 'Panda' arm to bring this data closer to the user. A QR code is placed in front of the 'Panda' arm, recognized and used as an anchor for the digital model. Finally, a user study was hosted, asking about the application and its impact on the work with the robot as well as the prospects for the future. For this, participants were able to test the augmented reality application on the real robot, the 'Panda' arm. The responses in this user study were extremely positive, which confirms the assumption that augmented reality applications are extremely useful for visualizing the states of machines.
