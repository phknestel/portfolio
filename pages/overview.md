  - Summary:
    - The overall goal of this research project is to develop a novel mobile robot assistant. It is designed as an extensible multifunction platform for a wide range of transport and service tasks. The project focuses on two innovative core topics:
      - Robust locomotion on various uneven surfaces
      - Effortless usability and interaction with people in dynamic environments
    - The motivation of these topics is above all the potential use of the robot in as many areas of the economy and public life as possible. The idea is that everyone can operate the robot, use it, and simply teach it to perform tasks. Challenges in security, physical interaction, intuitive usability, and learning ability have to be overcome.
    - _**Technologies used:**_ C++, ROS, RViz, Python
- Search and test an optional virtual test environment for robots similar to RViz
